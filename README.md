# Fitness-Coach-Chatbot
This is a chatbot created using OpenAI GPT-3 that can assist you with your fitness-related queries. The chatbot can help you with topics like workout, exercise, diet, nutrients, and more.

## Setup
You need to have an OpenAI API account in order to use the chatbot. Set up your OpenAI API credentials and change "My_Openai_API_Key" below the python code line with your real API key:

`openai.api_key = "My_Openai_API_Key"`

## Usage
To start the chatbot, run the following command in your terminal:

`python main.py`

The chatbot will welcome you and prompt you to enter your queries. You can ask questions related to fitness like workout, exercise, diet, nutrients, and more. The chatbot will provide you with relevant responses to your queries.

The chatbot can respond to queries containing the keywords workout,exercise,diet,working out, and nutrients.

## Code Structure
The code for the chatbot is organized into two functions:

1. `generate_response()`: This function takes in a prompt as input, sends it to the OpenAI API, and returns the response generated by GPT-3
2. `start_chatbot()`: This function starts the chatbot and prompts the user for input. It then checks if the input is related to fitness and if so, appends it to the prompt and sends it to *generate_response()* for a response. The chatbot continues to provide responses until the user inputs "exit".

The code also includes a prompt string that defines the initial prompt for the chatbot. This prompt can be modified to add or remove topics based on your requirements.

**Note**: The *max_tokens* and *temperature* parameters in the *generate_response()* function can be modified to control the length and randomness of the responses generated by GPT-3.
